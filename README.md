Project Title: SplitMate AI
A voice-first smart assistant for real-world bill splitting.
🧠 Problem Statement
Splitting expenses with friends—especially in group settings like dinners, trips, or shared subscriptions—is often awkward, error-prone, and time-consuming. Most tools require manual entry and don’t adapt well to natural conversation or real-world context.

💡 Solution Overview
SplitMate AI is a conversational AI tool that lets users split bills or shared costs using natural voice commands. It uses contextual intelligence to recommend friends for the split based on location history and previous group interactions, and supports both even and uneven splitting logic—all powered by speech.

🔧 Core Features
🎙️ Voice-Based Input: Users say things like "Split last night’s bill evenly among us" or "Give 60% to Alice, rest split between Raj and me."

🧠 Smart Friend Recommendation: Recommends people for the split based on:

GPS/location data (who was nearby).

Historical co-split activity.

⚖️ Even and Uneven Splits: Supports flexible, natural instructions.

📱 Visual Feedback: Displays final breakdown with confirmation before applying split.
